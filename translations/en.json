  "intro": "Our modern world is driven by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model'>Open Source</a> software. It runs on every computer, every smartphone or tablet and all your favorite apps would not run without it. It is developed mainly by volunteers and by hobbyists around the world, those geeks among your friends that love their computers more than hanging out with you. Open Source software is free and common property and allows everyone to use it and alter it to their needs. It relies on collective intelligence instead of the standards imposed by superiors. All this work is done for free! Utopian however rewards everyone who contributes to such projects, as long as a certain standard of quality is met.",
